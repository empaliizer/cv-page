                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p>
                  When I finished high school I knew I wanted to do something creative for a living. 
                  I took a class to learn nails and lashes and started my own business. 
                  I worked with that for 7 years. I had my saloon in my garden, 
                  I was always home and never left our house except when I went to the store. 
                  This and my fiance led me to take classes to learn programming and that also led me to 
                  web design. I love to create things for other people and companies. 
                </p>
                <p class="mt-s">The classes I took at Karlskoga Folkhögskola at first were on a basic level and I 
                  felt like I couldn't start working with that knowledge. That’s why I took my 
                  degree at Chas Academy that wanted us students to be ready to work as soon as possible. 
                  I’ve been working at a smaller business as a junior frontend designer. Now i want to 
                  try something new and to start working at bigger companies and work as a web 
                  designer/UX-designer together with a development team. </p>
